# 🐇 Rabbit Population Growth Simulation

This project was completed as part of my second year in a computer science bachelor's degree.

The goal was to build a simulation of the growth of a rabbit population using a high-quality pseudorandom number generator. The project also required detailed statistical analysis of the simulation results.

## ⚙️ Using the Simulation

### 🔧 Configurable Parameters
Before running the simulation, you can adjust two parameters:  
- **Number of independent experiments**: The number of simulation runs to perform during the experiment.  
- **Duration of each simulation in months**

These parameters can be modified directly in the `Main.java` file (lines 10 and 11).

### 🛠️ How to Compile
```bash
javac -sourcepath ./src/ -d ./out/ ./src/Main.java
```

### ▶️ How to Run
```bash
java -cp ./out/ Main
```
